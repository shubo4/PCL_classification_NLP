# PCL_classification_NLP

Here we test different classical and deep learning based NLP models to identify and categorize language that is patronizing or condescending towards vulnerable communities (e.g. refugees, homeless people, poor families).

# Don't Patronize me Dataset (https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08320)
